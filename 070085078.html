	<p><strong>Difficulties with the camera...</strong>come back for more on the <strike>Sunday the 8th of March</strike>Tuesday, the 10th of March! Since I am delaying the release, I will toss in some bonus content: Thin Mint experiment pictures...Content Release on the 8th of March: Home-made Mocha (maybe), Caramel Experiment (certain), and Thin Mints (certain).</p>

	<p>Peppermint patties...Certainly palatable, but not exactly delectable. I need to thin the chocolate. Experimenting with caramels at the moment</p>

	<p>Unedible results. Caramels turned out not as expected<em>(there seems to be a layer of oil...)</em> Oh well. At least the very experience of seeing sugar caramelizing (directly through my eyes rather than through the lenses of a camera+editing to a computer then to my eyes) was quite exciting. Also this is my first time using a candy thermometer :P&nbsp;As for other Thin Mints, I let the dough sit in the refridgerator too long (I made the dough almost <em>two weeks</em> ago but never found the time to bake it)...The dough is too dry (a test bake yielded extremely crunchy results). Maybe I will have better luck with the mocha tomorrow and more trials to come over the weekend :).</p>
	<p>So this PMM (Pearl Milk Mocha) was made with HOMEMADE mocha (instead of a pre-made frappuchino/mocha). To be honest, I think it tastes better :P (the bias :P)</p>
